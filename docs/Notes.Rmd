## From Maria
4 studies including males only: Sthoeger 1987. Folomeev 1990, Kaufman 1989, Chang 1995.
Also, Grigor should be excluded  (same cohort as Hohmeister).

## KM's

Voss is not a KM since it's x-axis is age, not years

Several studies have arms in different epochs: Urman, Uramoto, Rodriguez, and Funauchi
## Plots

## Digitized Plots

Several plots are really survival estimates and not KM plots

## Study duration

We're taking Estes to be 1961-1969 based on very sketchy information in the paper.
